  Dialogue:
  - Yeehaw! Welcome to the outback, partner!
  - Thank you kindly for saving me! Some sort of evil force has infected our land..
    but I've got some info that might be of use to ya.
  - That special camera you've got? You can activate it by pressing TAB. Alls it
    takes is a quick click after that!
  - That not enough for ya? Spice up your photos with a quick zoom on the Scroll
    Wheel. You can always reset it by clickin' the Scroll Wheel, 'course.
  - Say, this place is lookin' mighty drab. Go ahead and try takin' a few pictures,
    I got a feeling it might brighten the place up! Long as you're near a friendly
    face, at least.
