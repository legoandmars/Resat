  Dialogue:
  - Hey, could you help me gather some firewood so I can put together a fire?
  - What? Everybody else in town is glitchy and corrupted?
  - Huh. Things HAVE seemed awfully lacking in color recently... but I figured that
    was just ash from all the fires I've been building.
  - Well, what are you waiting for? If anything, that firewood just got HIGHER priority.
