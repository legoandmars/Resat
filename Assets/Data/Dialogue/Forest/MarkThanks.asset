  Dialogue:
  - Thanks for the wood. This fire came out pretty well, if I do say so myself!
  - Feel free to come back here anytime. There will always be a warm place to stay,
    so to speak.
  - I am not joking. My previous month's fire uptime was 99.4%. The past few minutes
    have actually been quite catacylsmic for my long term statistics.
